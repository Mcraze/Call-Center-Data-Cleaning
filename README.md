# Call Center Customer Data Cleaning

### Problem Statement:
The goal of this data cleaning task is to prepare a clean and usable dataset for the call center team. The dataset contains customer information, including their names, contact phone numbers, addresses, and two important columns: "Paying Customer" and "Do_Not_Contact." The call center team needs to focus their phone calls on customers who have explicitly indicated "No" in the "Do_Not_Contact" column, while excluding those who have opted out.

### Final Conclusion:
The dataset has been cleaned and is now ready for the call center's use. Irrelevant columns have been removed, duplicate values eliminated, and rows without phone numbers removed. Data consistency has been improved by converting "Yes" to "Y" and "No" to "N". Phone numbers now have a consistent format, and addresses have been split for better readability. Names have been cleaned and normalized.
